# CICD_for_object_detection

In this project, I have tried to build a CICD pipeline for object detection use-case on Kaggle's [Global Wheat Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/global-wheat-detection/data). 

To run the pipeline, follow this [medium article](https://medium.com/@ravishukla1996/ci-cd-pipeline-for-object-detection-using-amazon-sagemaker-and-github-actions-82183808a7bf) where I have discussed in details regarding all the required steps.
